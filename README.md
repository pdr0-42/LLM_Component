# FastAPI LLM Project

## Description

This project is an API built with FastAPI that provides a service for calling an OpenAI language model (LLM). The API acts as an interface between the user and the LLM, allowing for efficient and scalable interactions with the language model.

## Features

- Integration with OpenAI LLM models
- RESTful API built with FastAPI
- Interactive API documentation
- Easy setup and deployment

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- pip (Python package manager)
- Access to OpenAI API (API key)

## Installation and Configuration

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository
   ```

2. Environment variables setup:
   - Request the necessary environment variables from the system administrator.
   - These variables typically include the OpenAI API key and possibly other project-specific configurations.

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Project

1. In the project root, run the following command:
   ```
   python asgi.py
   ```

2. Open your browser and access the interactive API documentation:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:8080/docs#/
   ```

## Using the API

The interactive documentation (Swagger UI) provided by FastAPI offers a user-friendly interface to test and interact with the API endpoints. You can:

1. Explore available endpoints
2. Test API calls directly through the interface
3. View request and response schemas
